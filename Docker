A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly 
and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable 
package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers 
- images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

Docker containers that run on Docker Engine:

Standard: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere.
Lightweight: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, 
driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs.
Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry.

Docker Engine enables containerized applications to run anywhere consistently on any infrastructure,
solving “dependency hell” for developers and operations teams, and eliminating the “it works on my laptop!” problem.
